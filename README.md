## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Media Queries

### What I learned

I mostly tried to be efficient with the code. 

### Continued development

Nothing in particular to add here, but any comments for improvement are welcome!

I do have a doubt and that is if I could've done the margin-right and margin-left part in the .card in a better way.
